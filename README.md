# ABAP Text Element Search

This small program lets you search values in text elements of programs, classes and function groups. I wrote this because I couldn't find a standard program doing the same thing.

You can run it via ZBC135.

[Addict](https://github.com/keremkoseoglu/addict) is a prerequisite for this app.
